# Stellar Analysis Logger

**This plugin for Elite Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC) logs detailed exploration data and system information into a database of mine.**

Note: I only collect astrophysical data from the Pilots Journal regarding Stars, Planets, Moons and Astroid Belts, and nothing else.

This project is highly inspired from [BGS-Tally](https://github.com/aussig/BGS-Tally) by [aussig](https://github.com/aussig).

## Features

- Captures and logs detailed exploration data from the Pilot's Journal.
- Records stellar body information, including planets, moons, and stars.
- Tracks surface scan data, and geological and biological findings.
- Logs payload information for analysis.
- Works seamlessly with EDMC.
